# Progress: Test Case Management (TCM) System

## What Works
- **Refactoring**: Standardized on "Submodule" across the stack (Entity, DB, API, UI).
- **Project Infrastructure**: Backend (Spring Boot) and Frontend (Angular) robust setup.
// ...
## Current Status
The application has undergone a second significant refactoring to further simplify terminology from "Test Submodule" to just "Submodule". The API endpoints have been updated to match. Most frontend components have been transitioned, but a few display templates still need field renaming. The database schema will reset on next start to apply the `submodules` table name change.
